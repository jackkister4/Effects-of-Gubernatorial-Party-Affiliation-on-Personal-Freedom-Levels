-Final Paper with analysis: The Impact of Democratic and Republican Governors on Personal Freedom in the U.S.

This paper is an empirical economic paper that looks the effect of gubernatorial party affiliation on levels of personal freedom in different states in the United States. To accomplish this, I use regression discontinuity design as well as gubernatorial election data and the personal freedom index (PFI) from the Cato Institute's Freedom in the 50 States 2023 report. I also look at three categories of the PFI and how gubernatorial party affiliation affects these categories, those being gun freedom, tobacco freedom, and cannabis freedom.


-Data sets: Freedom in the 50 states raw excel file, Governor elections missing excel file, Run R file "governor_data_download" to download gubernatorial data

-Data cleaning: run gubernatorial_data_script to merge and clean all data sets when all data files are in the same folder and change working directory to that specific folder in Stata do file

-Regression discontinuity analysis: -once data set is finished (after cleaning), run the results replication file after setting working directory using Stata do file "Results Replication File"
